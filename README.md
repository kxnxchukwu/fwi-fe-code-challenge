## Getting Started and Challenge Information

This challenge will test your ability to:

- work in an existing code base
- use React, CSS, and redux
- consume/create data from a RESTful API

To make things easier from the get-go, we have provided both a backend RESTful
API as well as a starter front end app using [nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and
some default "reasonable" styles.

This app will start with the ability to view every poker player in the database
and list them within a table. Your job will be to update this app so that
players can be added, modified, or deleted using the RESTful API backend we have
provided. The app started with very simplistic styles, so feel free to import
and use any of your favorite libraries or expand upon the current styles to your
liking. If possible, ensure that the FWI branding colors are still used which
can be found in [src/\_variables.scss](src/_variables.scss).

### Cloning and developing

Applicants should not fork this repository directly; rather, they should
initialize their own repositories and pull this repository's content in:

```
username @ ~/
$ mkdir fwi-fe-code-challenge
$ cd fwi-fe-code-challenge
$ git init
$ git remote add origin https://github.com/USERNAME/fwi-fe-code-challenge
$ git remote add remote-origin https://github.com/fourwindsinteractive/fwi-fe-code-challenge
$ git pull remote-origin main
$ git push origin main
```

The steps above will create an empty git repo, set the origin to your GitHub
code challenge location, then pull the latest code challenge into your repo, and
push it to your GitHub. Once you have done all of this, you should be set to
start the code challenge.

The code challenge can be completed in either Javascript or Typescript so you
can choose whichever language you prefer.

> There are few type definitions available in the
> [src/appTypes](./src/appTypes/) folder.

#### Getting Started

```sh
yarn --ignore-optional
yarn dev
```

This will install all the dependencies and start the dev server at
http://localhost:3000.

> The `--ignore-optional` flag is added to skip installing
> [cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) since it's a large download and isn't
> required to complete the code challenge. If you want to use cypress after
> completing the rest of the code challenge, you will need to run `yarn --force`
> or `rm -rf node_modules && yarn`.

#### Available Commands

- `yarn dev` - Run the [nextjs](https://nextjs.org) dev server and API routes
- `yarn lint` - Run [eslint](https://eslint.org)
- `yarn test` - Run tests with [jest](https://jestjs.io)
- `yarn test-cy` - Opens the [cyress](https://cypress.io) test runner
- `yarn test-cy-ci` - Run tests with [cyress](https://cypress.io) from the
  command line
- `yarn build` - Create a production build
- `yarn start` - Run the production server

### Submitting the code

Before submitting your code, make sure that there are no console errors within
your app and everything works as expected. We have also provided a very simple
checklist below for the main features that we are looking for, and you can mark
a task as completed by replacing the space with an `x`:

```diff
- [ ] Create Player
+ [x] Create Player
```

When you are ready, please send an email to your FWI recruiter with a link to
your GitHub repo and any additional instructions for running the project if you
added any additional steps.

### Challenge Checklist

- [x] Create Player
- [x] Modify Player
- [x] Delete Player
- [x] Implement sorting (optional)
- [ ] Lazy loading/pagination (optional)
- [ ] Tests (optional)

## API Documentation

Check out the [Player typescript interface](./src/appTypes/players.ts) to see
what a poker player looks like.

### Get all players

You can get a list of all the players be sending a `GET` request to
`/api/players`:

```sh
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://localhost:3000/api/players"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "314c5ab7-ba9b-4821-adba-b4f9d92009db",
      "name": "Freddy Kruger",
      "country": "US",
      "winnings": 93024,
      "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=314c5ab7-ba9b-4821-adba-b4f9d92009db"
    },
    {
      "id": "70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a",
      "name": "Bob Bobbity",
      "country": "US",
      "winnings": 93024,
      "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a"
    }
    // ... other players
  ]
}
```

#### Get All Players (Paginated)

This endpoint will also support pagination using the `start` and `size` query
parameters:

```sh
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://localhost:3000/api/players?size=24"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "from": 0,
  "size": 24,
  "total": 1000,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "314c5ab7-ba9b-4821-adba-b4f9d92009db",
      "name": "Freddy Kruger",
      "country": "US",
      "winnings": 93024,
      "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=314c5ab7-ba9b-4821-adba-b4f9d92009db"
    },
    {
      "id": "70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a",
      "name": "Bob Bobbity",
      "country": "US",
      "winnings": 93024,
      "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a"
    }
    // ... other players
  ]
}
```

So if you would like to get the next set of results, you can do:

```sh
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://localhost:3000/api/players?size=24&from=24"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "from": 24,
  "size": 24,
  "total": 1000,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "0ef94f22-e727-4888-91e3-088be5dbd896",
      "name": "Scott Sterling",
      "country": "UK",
      "winnings": 93024,
      "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=0ef94f22-e727-4888-91e3-088be5dbd896"
    },
    {
      "id": "4f3b5ce4-2072-47d4-beb8-d46a9a0a8c9f",
      "name": "Stirling Archer",
      "country": "US",
      "winnings": 9302400,
      "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=4f3b5ce4-2072-47d4-beb8-d46a9a0a8c9f"
    }
    // ... other players
  ]
}
```

#### Get All Players (Sorted)

This endpoint will also support sorting using the `sortBy` and `sortOrder` query
parameters:

```sh
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://localhost:3000/api/players?sortBy=name&sortOrder=desc"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "from": 0,
  "size": 24,
  "total": 1000,
  "items": [
    {
      "id": "314c5ab7-ba9b-4821-adba-b4f9d92009db",
      "name": "Freddy Kruger",
      "country": "US",
      "winnings": 93024,
      "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=314c5ab7-ba9b-4821-adba-b4f9d92009db"
    },
    {
      "id": "70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a",
      "name": "Bob Bobbity",
      "country": "US",
      "winnings": 93024,
      "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a"
    }
    // ... other players
  ]
}
```

Check out the [sort function](./src/server/controllers.ts#L53) to see how the
data is sorted and valid `sortBy`/`sortOrder` values.

### Get a player

You can get a single player by sending a `GET` request to `/api/players/:guid`:

```sh
$ curl -H "Accept: application/json" \
    "http://localhost:3000/api/players/70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a"
```

Response:

```json
{
  "id": "70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a",
  "name": "Bob Bobbity",
  "country": "US",
  "winnings": 93024,
  "imageUrl": "https://i.pravatar.cc/40?u=70629df2-571a-4899-b36a-8f36c909508a"
}
```

### Create a player

To create a player, you can send a `POST` to `/api/players` with the following
data:

```ts
interface Player {
  name: string;
  country: string;
  winnings: number;
  imageUrl?: string;
}
```

The `imageUrl` will be optional as the BE will automatically create a `pravatar`
url for you if omitted. After you create a player and it was successful, you
should get a `201` response as well as a `Location` header pointing to the newly
created player:

```sh
$ curl -d '{ "name": "New Person", "country": "US", "winnings": 1000 }' \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -X POST "http://localhost:3000/api/players"
```

Response:

```sh
201 Created
Location: http://localhost:3000/api/players/0ef94f22-e727-4888-91e3-088be5dbd896
```

### Update a player

To update a player, you can send a `PATCH` to `/api/players/:guid` with the
updated data:

```sh
$ curl -d '{ "name": "Example Name" }' \
    -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
    -X PATCH \
    "http://localhost:3000/api/players/314c5ab7-ba9b-4821-adba-b4f9d92009db"
```

### Delete a player

Finally, to delete a player, you can send a `DELETE` to `/api/players/:guid`:

```sh
$ curl -X DELETE \
    "http://localhost:3000/api/players/4f3b5ce4-2072-47d4-beb8-d46a9a0a8c9f"
```
